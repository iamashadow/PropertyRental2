Our focus has always been on quality service and working together to achieve an ideal outcome for our valued clients. We aim to build our brand and positively redefine the real estate market with personal and exceptional service.\n\n"

  "J&B Makelaars was established in 2016 by experienced international estate agent Bridgette Ball and her husband Jason Ball. We wanted to establish a brand that we felt best represented our values. Over the years the business has shown a natural growth in the expat property market as we have an understanding of having walked in the shoes of our clients being expats ourselves.\n\n"

  "That is why, for a period, the company was renamed Expat Property Brokers and began focusing primarily on expat property. With this success, more expat agencies began targeting the expat market, positioning themselves as expat specialists, and the name “Expat Property Brokers” became diluted, becoming as “an” rather than “the” expat property brokerage. Hence, in 2023 we decided to change our name back to J&B Makelaars.\n\n"

  "We are returning to our roots as J&B Makelaars to serve expats with a specialised, personal touch,” says Bridgette. “We want our clients to feel like they’ve found a true home whenever they come to us for assistance. This is whether they are looking for a rental, buying a new home or selling their existing property.\n\n"

  "Our mission at J&B Makelaars remains the same – to provide comprehensive real estate services tailored specifically for expats in the Netherlands. Our goal is to help you find your next home easily and confidently. We are Your Expat Property Broker, an experienced team that understands how to handle your real estate needs as an expat.\n\n"

  "Our keen understanding of the market and our clients’ needs allow us to craft the best estate solutions that offer exceptional service to clients at affordable rates.";

//Q : 3
  static final String question3 = "What is an offer-by-deadline?";
  static final String q3ansp1 = "The offer-by-deadline process, also known as the ‘Inschrijven,’ is a common way of selling homes"
      " in the Netherlands. In this process, the seller sets a deadline for receiving offers from potential buyers. Interested parties "
      "are then given the opportunity to submit their offer before the deadline, and the seller can choose to accept or reject any of "
      "the offers received.\n\n"

      "One of the benefits of this process is that it creates a sense of urgency for both the buyer and the seller. "
      "Buyers are motivated to submit their best offer before the deadline, this is normally a blind bidding system. "
      "While sellers are able to review all the offers received and choose the one that best meets their needs.\n\n"

      "However, it is important to note that the offer-by-deadline process is not a guarantee that the highest bidder "
      "will be the one who gets the house. In the Netherlands, sellers are not required to disclose the details of the "
      "offers they receive, so it is possible that a lower bid with more favourable terms or fewer contingencies may be "
      "accepted over a higher bid with less favourable terms.\n\n"

      "When participating in the offer-by-deadline process, it is important to do your research and come prepared with a strong offer."
      " This may involve working with a real estate agent to understand the local market and determine an appropriate offer price,"
      " as well as reviewing the terms and conditions of the offer to ensure that they align with your needs and budget.\n\n"

      "It is crucial to be mindful of any potential contingencies or conditions that may be involved in the offer when making"
      " a bid on a home. For instance, if financing is required to purchase the property, it is essential to incorporate a"
      " financing contingency in the offer that permits you to withdraw from the deal if obtaining financing is not feasible."
      " However, financing is just one of the many factors to consider when constructing an offer. It is recommended to engage a"
      " knowledgeable buying agent who can provide you with the necessary advice and direction in submitting the strongest offer for"
      " the property. Every home and offer are distinct and cannot be compared. The offer must be tailored to the specific property "
      "you have viewed, the number of potential buyers, the pricing in the area, and the features of the home.\n\n";




//Q : 4
  static final String question4 = "How to apply for a building load";
  static final String q4ansp1 = "If you are planning to renovate or expand your home and need additional financing, "
      "you can request a building loan facility along with your mortgage.  At the point of doing your bank evaluation (taxatie) "
      "you will need to let the evaluator know what changes you want to make this is done by completing a “verbouwings specificatie” "
      "(renovation specification). This document should include detailed information about the renovations you plan to undertake, such as "
      "the scope of the project and estimated costs.\n\n"
      "Once you have provided all the necessary information, the lender will review your application and determine whether to approve "
      "the additional financing. If your application is approved, in most cases the funds will be released in stages, as the renovations "
      "progress, and you will need to provide proof of completion for each stage before receiving the next instalment.  Very important to"
      " consider that in some cases the lender will only cover 70% of the project and 30 % might need to be paid by you to the notary on "
      "registration of the building fund.  This 30 % is paid over to the bank and held in the fund along with the 70% for the renovation project.";
